# Game plan

_Inspired by [Coffee run (The blender studio film)](https://studio.blender.org/films/coffee-run/)_

## Concept

- Running through a map, with multiple obstacles, with your energy levels slowly going down before reaching a coffee cup to refill again.
- The movement should be centered around keeping your momentum.
