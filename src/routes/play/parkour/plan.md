# Original game plan

> [!NOTE]
> I moved away from this idea pretty quickly into development, because it did not really work. This is the reason why the "level transporter" is a coffee cup. A lot is still similar, except for the energy levels.

_Inspired by [Coffee run (The blender studio film)](https://studio.blender.org/films/coffee-run/)_

## Concept

- Running through a map, with multiple obstacles, with your energy levels slowly going down before reaching a coffee cup to refill again.
- The movement should be centered around keeping your momentum.
